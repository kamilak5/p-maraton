# Half Marathon Project - Time Prediction

## Project Description

Developed a machine learning application that predicts half-marathon finish times based on user demographics and 5K race performance, leveraging both structured data and natural-language inputs.

- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and preprocessing on real-world race datasets  
- Trained regression models on 2023 race data and validated performance on a 2024 event dataset to ensure temporal generalization, selecting Lasso for accuracy and interpretability  
- Integrated GPT-4 to convert unstructured text input into structured features using JSON parsing and chat completions  
- Deployed the model via a Streamlit app hosted on DigitalOcean  
- Implemented real-time monitoring of model and LLM performance using Langfuse  
- Managed API keys and configuration securely through environment variables 

This project demonstrates a complete data science pipelineâ€”from data exploration and modeling to deployment, LLM integration, and production monitoring.
